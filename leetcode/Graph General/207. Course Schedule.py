# There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
#For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
# Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

# Example 1:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

# Example 2:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
