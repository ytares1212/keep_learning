# Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

#     Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
#     Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
#     Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

# Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 19
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
# 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
# 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
# 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: false
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 1:
            return True
        seen = set()
        num = n
        
        while num != 1:

            if num in seen:
                return False

            seen.add(num)
            string = str(num)
            length = len(string)
            sum_ofs = 0
            for i in range(length):
                sum_ofs += int(string[i]) * int(string[i])
            num = sum_ofs
        return True
