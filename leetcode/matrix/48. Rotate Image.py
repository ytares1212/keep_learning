# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

# Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
# Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
